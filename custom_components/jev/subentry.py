"""Questions built in the UI, one subentry each.

The YAML surface makes you declare a context: a named group of questions that
share one API call. That grouping is not a preference, it is derivable. TypeSafe
takes one state and N questions, so two questions can share a call exactly when
they describe the same state, and cannot when they do not, whatever the user
writes. A UI that asks for it would be asking the user to hand back an answer the
integration already has.

So a subentry is one question, carrying what it looks at and how often. The call
grouping is computed from those fields at setup, which keeps the measured saving
(three questions took 712 ms, a hundred took 714) without putting the word
"context" in front of anyone.
