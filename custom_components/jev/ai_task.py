"""An AI Task entity, so a script can ask a question and act on the answer at once.

A question subentry is evaluated on a schedule and lands in a sensor, which is the
right shape when you want the answer over time. It is the wrong shape inside a
script: the sensor can still hold the answer from before the change that started
the script, because a trigger wakes the context through a 5 second debounce. This
entity answers at the moment it is called.

Home Assistant allows a task with no `structure`, which asks for free text. Jev
returns typed answers and nothing else, so that call is refused here rather than
answered with something invented.

Attachments need no handling: ai_task refuses them before the task reaches an
entity that does not declare SUPPORT_ATTACHMENTS.
