"""Turn an AI Task structure into Jev questions, and the answers back into values.

Home Assistant builds `task.structure` out of selector instances: ai_task reads the
`selector:` block of every field and calls `selector.selector(...)` on it, so what
arrives here is a BooleanSelector or a SelectSelector, not a type name. The mapping
therefore reads selector classes. Going through voluptuous_openapi to get a JSON
schema first would mean a new requirement to say the same thing.

Three selectors map onto the three question types and nothing else does. A field
this module cannot map is refused before the request, so a badly shaped task costs
nothing.
