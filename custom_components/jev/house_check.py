"""A look at the house for things that are probably wrong, shown as Repairs cards.

Two checks read Home Assistant only and cost no tokens: an entity that has been
unavailable for a week, and a battery below 10%. The third asks Jev one yes/no
question, all in one request, for each entity the conversation agent can control:
is this state a mistake someone would want to fix now, given the time and the rest
of the house. That list comes from the snapshot, so it never holds a lock.

Each finding is a Repairs card. The unavailable entities of one config entry share
one card, because an integration that lost its device or its server takes every
entity with it: on one test instance, 438 of 518 came from one integration. A card's
fix flow ignores its entities, snoozes them for 30 days or, for a light, switch or
fan that is on, turns it off. A turn-off keeps the state it replaced, and
`jev.undo_house_check` puts it back. Nothing here changes a lock, cover, climate or
valve.
