"""How big a request is, before it is sent.

The pre-flight budget check has to know what a call will cost while there is still
time to refuse it, and the only honest input is the body jevclient is about to
post. This builds the same dict and measures it.

jevclient owns the real one. tests/test_payload.py posts through a real JevClient
against a fake session and asserts the two byte counts match, so a shape change in
the library fails a test instead of quietly biasing every estimate.
