"""Turn one spoken command into a Home Assistant intent.

Two rules shape this file, both measured rather than assumed.

Digits are pulled out in code. Jev judges and does not calculate, and asking it to
read "set the lamp to 40 percent" as a number separated cases by 0.06 where doing
the comparison first gave 0.69. A regex is exact and free. A level said in words,
"forty percent" or "half", has no digit to read, and only then does a second
request ask for it.

Every question the router could need goes in one request, including the five or so
that will be discarded. Three questions took 712 ms and a hundred took 714, so the
alternative, a chain of calls each waiting on the last, is slower and costs more.
