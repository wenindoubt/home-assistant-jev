# questions, 137 and 613 bytes, was billed 279 and 377. A straight line through
# each pair crosses zero bytes at 209 and 251 tokens. 250 is near the higher one.

# live. Less the fixed part, that is 2.80 to 2.91 bytes per token. The low end is the
# one that over-estimates the cost.
#
# An answered call with a body worth measuring replaces it with the ratio that

# entity record measured on the live API for a state-only record, that scales to
# about 110 tokens per entity per command, so this cap is roughly 16,500 input
# tokens or $0.0007. It also stays under the 255 option ceiling a Choice question
