"""Cases for the blueprints about heating, air, weather and the garden.

Three of these blueprints call `weather.get_forecasts`, and two of them operate one
device directly (`fan.set_percentage`, `switch.turn_on`/`turn_off`). No weather, fan
or switch platform is set up in this test Home Assistant, so the helpers below
register those services. The device services record what they were called with,
and a case says exactly which calls it expects, including none.

The clock in these tests is frozen at the real time the test starts, so a forecast
is built at the moment the blueprint asks for it, relative to that clock. A fixed
date would make the "hours ahead" and "after today" filters depend on when the
suite runs.
