# Jev for Home Assistant

Ask [TypeSafe Jev](https://typesafe.ai) questions about your house and get numbers
back. Jev is a decision model, not a chat model. It answers a typed question with a
probability, a choice or a score, and this integration turns each answer into an
entity you can automate on.

**[Full documentation](https://jev.cdevries.dev)**

Not affiliated with TypeSafe. The API client is
[jevclient](https://github.com/AboveColin/jevclient).

![Every question becomes an entity, with the day's spend beside it](docs/images/entities.png)

## What it does

- [Questions](https://jev.cdevries.dev/questions-ui/) become sensors: a probability,
  one of your options with its distribution, or a number on a scale. Add them in the
  UI, [in YAML](https://jev.cdevries.dev/questions-yaml/), or both.
- Four [actions](https://jev.cdevries.dev/actions/), `jev.noul`, `jev.choice`,
  `jev.score` and `jev.ask`, answer inside an automation and return a response
  variable.
- An [AI Task](https://jev.cdevries.dev/ai-task/) entity answers
  `ai_task.generate_data` when it is called. A boolean, select or number field
  becomes the matching question.
- A [conversation agent](https://jev.cdevries.dev/conversation/) for Assist routes
  spoken commands through the same model.
- A [house check](https://jev.cdevries.dev/house-check/) opens a Repairs card for
  entities unavailable for a week, low batteries and, in one request, states that
  look like a mistake. A light left on can be turned off from its card and put back.
- It [reports what it spends](https://jev.cdevries.dev/cost/): calls, input tokens and
  estimated cost per day, against a daily token budget.
- 25 [blueprints](https://jev.cdevries.dev/blueprints/) to import with one click.
  Seven start from your own question, and 18 handle one situation each, such as a
  forgotten washing machine or a window open while the heating runs.
- Fifteen worked [examples](examples/), four of them pairing Jev with an LLM.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Remind about the washing
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.jev_laundry_forgotten
        to: "on"
        for: "00:10:00"
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: The washing is done and still in the machine.
```

## Installation

Requires Home Assistant 2026.9 or newer and an API key from
[typesafe.ai](https://typesafe.ai).

### HACS

Jev is not in the HACS default list, so add it as a custom repository once.

1. HACS, then the three dot menu, then **Custom repositories**.
2. Paste `https://github.com/AboveColin/HA-Jev`, set Type to **Integration**, **Add**.
3. Search HACS for **Jev**, then **Download**.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=AboveColin&repository=HA-Jev&category=integration)

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/jev` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/AboveColin/HA-Jev/releases/latest) into your
`config/custom_components/` directory and restart. HACS does not update a copy
installed this way.

## Setup

Settings, Devices and services, Add integration, then **Jev (TypeSafe)**. Enter your
API key. The address field already holds the TypeSafe API.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=jev)

To use an OpenRouter key, set the address to `https://openrouter.ai/api` and the model
to `~typesafe/jev-latest`. The [install page](https://jev.cdevries.dev/install/) has
every option, and how to point the integration at a proxy.

Then [ask your first question](https://jev.cdevries.dev/first-question/).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the full
check a change must pass, and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) the rules for coding agents.

The easiest contribution is a blueprint. If an automation at your home asks Jev
something, put it in `blueprints/automation/jev/` with a test case, and the
[blueprint page](https://jev.cdevries.dev/blueprints/) credits you. Not writing it
yourself? Open a
[blueprint idea](https://github.com/AboveColin/HA-Jev/issues/new?template=blueprint_idea.yml).

Use Python 3.14. The pinned `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` requires it, and
3.13 fails at install with "No matching distribution found".

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pytest
```

The tests run the integration inside a real Home Assistant with the API client
replaced, so the suite spends nothing.

## Supporting the project

Jev for Home Assistant is free and stays free. If it is useful to you, you can support its
development through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/AboveColin).
Sponsorship is voluntary and unlocks nothing: every feature, fix and security
update ships in the public release.
